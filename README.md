# eth2-shuffle

Shuffling algorithm for ETH 2.0.

**work in progress**

Implemented in four ways:

1. Shuffle elements in array
2. Shuffle individual element (get permuted index)
3. Un-shuffle (i.e. reverse of shuffle effect) elements in array
4. Un-shuffle individual element (get un-permuted index)

Implementation can be found in `shuffle.go`

Tests and benchmarks can be found in `shuffle_test.go`
